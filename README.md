# SubwayViz
Subway viz for curriculum mapping.  A Data visualization that creates an interactive map that looks like a subway.

This visualization started in D3, then moved to Raphael and is now just using Snap.svg.  It takes JSON data on online curriculum and maps that information to a subway like line visualization.

The code handles intersections, group stops and hubs, achievment nodes, etc.

No database is required it references and oData backend service in the later versions.  The earlier versions are completely independant and can be deployed locally no problem.
